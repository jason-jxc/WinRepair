# Archived
I no longer want to maintain Fixdows considering Windows is on a downwards spiral, which makes me want to boycott it. (Just search up Windows 11.) You can maintain it if you want to.

Fixdows is a tool made in C# to repair common issues among Windows computers.
Sort of a continuation of [Winblows Maintenance Tool](https://github.com/Odyssey346/Winblows-Maintenance-Tool).

## How to build
### Note
There's a page in the Wiki that explains this in better detail. Below isn't suitable. Click [here](https://github.com/Odyssey346/Fixdows/wiki/Contributing-Code).
<hr />

-  Install VS 2019. Make sure you have .NET Development selected in the installer.
-  From there, just clone the repo from here, and then build it in Visual Studio, just press Build Fixdows in the Build section of the window titlebar and you are good to go. It will be located in bin/Debug in your Fixdows source code folder.
